          THESIS: Barracks is a considered barbershop worth visiting, not a dashboard wearing a marketing skin.
          OWN-WORLD: warm ivory paper, near-black editorial blocks, quiet rules, restrained green and amber signals, and photography that carries the page.
          STORY: visitors understand the Barracks standard, browse services and barbers, find a Davao chair, and book an appointment.
          FIRST VIEWPORT: a compact light navbar above a dark two-column hero, followed immediately by a two-image tools-and-chair collage.
          FORM: brief-pinned reference-led editorial barbershop composition.
          FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, and DESIGN.md
